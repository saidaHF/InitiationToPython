This project contains materials and resources related to the Python Introductory
course at ALBA.

At least it contains:

- Slides for the course
- Proposed exercises and my solutions to them

About the exercises
-------------------

After each session, some exercises will be proposed, and the solutions from 
each attendee will be personally reviewed by me. On the next session(s) we will 
comment the different approaches and common problems.

Each attendee should *fork* this repo (use the "fork" button) and upload his/her
own solution to the "solutions" directory. I will add personalized comments 
there.

(Note, all this can be done using the web interface)
