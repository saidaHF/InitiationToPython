Python Introduction Course
==========================

This project contains materials and resources related to the Python Introductory
course at ALBA.

At least it contains:

- Slides for the course (they are just and index of topics that will be 
  explained in practice.

- Proposed exercises and my solutions to them

- solutions directory (empy, to be filled by the attendees, see below)

Pre-course checklist
--------------------

- make sure that python 2.x, ipython, matplotlib, scipy and spyder are 
  installed in your PC. If you use windows, just install 
  [PythonXY](http://python-xy.github.io). Try at least to launch spyder once. 
  If you need assistance, please contact Systems.

- read this intro: http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html

- follow this tutorial: http://introtopython.org/var_string_num.html

- and the first part (till the first block of exercises) of:
  http://introtopython.org/lists_tuples.html

About the exercises and solutions
---------------------------------

After each session, some exercises will be proposed, and the solutions from 
each attendee will be personally reviewed by me. On the next session(s) we will 
comment the different approaches and common problems.

Each attendee should [fork](https://gitcomputing.cells.es/cpascual/pythoncourse-intro/fork) this repo (use the "fork" button) and upload his/her
own solution to the "solutions" directory. I will add personalized comments 
there.
