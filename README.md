# Python Introduction Course

This project contains materials and resources related to the Python Introductory
course at ALBA:

## Goal of the course

At the end of this course you should be able to:

- create your own simple python programs from scratch
- write structured programs (using functions, etc)
- know basic libraries for science use (numpy, scipy, matplotlib,...) and for 
  writing and reading from files
- interact (reading and writing attributes) with a Tango system with python
- be able to generate your own GUIs using TaurusGUI and existing Taurus widgets 
  (note that this is diffenrent from being able to create your own widgets)

What this course will **not** teach you:

- object-oriented programming (see [the python-intermediate course](https://git.cells.es/cpascual/pythoncourse-intermediate))
- how to create GUIs from scratch, or how to modify existing GUI widgets programmatically
- how to write sardana macros (although it will give you a lot of tools that will help you learn that easily)

## Course contents:

- [Slides](pythonIntro-slides.odp) for the course (they are just and index of topics that will be 
  explained in practice.
- Proposed [exercises](exercises) and my [solutions](exercises/cheat) to them

## Participant requirements

The course does not require any previous experience with python. Familiarity 
with other programming languages will help you a lot, but it is also not required.

But the course requires **commitment**. It consists on 5 sessions of half a day 
(~4h) and participants are expected to dedicate *at least* 2h after each session 
working on the proposed exercises (the exact time depends a lot on the previous 
programming experience of the participant). **Attending to sessions and doing 
the exercises is a strong requisite to be able to follow the next session**, 
so realistically do not expect to have much time for other stuff during course 
days.


## Pre-course checklist

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to follow this checklist **before** starting the course:

- install the needed software (python2.7, scipy, pyqtgraph and an IDE). It is 
  highly recommended that you follow [these instructions](pre-course.md)). 
  *(Expected required time: 20'-60'  , Priority: very high)*

- Familiarize yourself with the most basic concepts of python:

  - Read [this intro](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html)
    *(Expected required time: 30'-60'  , Priority: very high)*

  - Follow [this tutorial](http://introtopython.org/var_string_num.html)
    *(Expected required time: 60'-180'  , Priority: high)*

  - And also follow **the first part** (till the first block of exercises) of
    [this other tutorial](http://introtopython.org/lists_tuples.html)
    *(Expected required time: 10'-20' , Priority: high)*
