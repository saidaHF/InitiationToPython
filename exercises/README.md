Python Introduction exercises 
=============================

At the end of each session, some exercises from this directory will be 
proposed, which you should try to solve before the next session. 

If you submit your solution I will review it and make comments (see the 
procedure below).

On the following session, we will discuss the different approaches and 
common problems/solutions.

Procedure for submitting your exercises:
----------------------------------------

1. Go to the [exercises page][1] and download the file corresponding to the 
   exercise that you want to solve
   
2. Open the downloaded file (e.g., whith spyder) and solve the exercise, testing
   it in your PC

3. When finished, go back to the [exercises page from my repository][1]
   (see important note below). Then click on the file corresponding to the 
   exercise and select `Edit`. Copy & Paste your code here and click on the 
   `Commit Changes` button

4. You will be presented with a new page called `New Merge Request`. Just click 
   on the `Submit merge request` button. If you do not get here, it is probably 
   because you are editing a file in your own repository instead of mine 
   (see note below).
   
5. This will create a *merge-request* which is where I will add comments when I 
   review the code that you wrote. You can also add comments in this 
   merge-request. Note: You can access your merge-requests at any time from 
   [here](http://gitlab.com/alba-synchrotron/controls-section/pythoncourse-intro/merge_requests)
   (tip: filter by "author" to see only your requests)
 
6. If, as a result of the review, you want to resubmit your code, just close 
   this merge-request and repeat steps 3-5.


**NOTE:** In step 3, make sure that you are editing the exercise file from 
[exercises page from MY repository][1], **not yours**. Just check that on the 
top-left of the page it says **cpascual**/*pythoncourse-intro*, not 
*YOUR_USER_NAME/pythoncourse-intro*.
Explanation: if you have already submitted a merge-request, a *fork* (copy) of 
my repository will have been created for you automatically.
But in order for me to review your solutions, you need to edit *MY* file so that 
a merge-request is created.
