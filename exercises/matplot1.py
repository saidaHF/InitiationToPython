Exercise: matplot1
------------------

Do a script that reads the "converted1.dat" created in the converter1
exercise and plots counts VS time. The script should automatically
save this plot in a file called "mp1.png"

Once you got it, change the Y axis to log scale.
Add titles for the axes in the plot. The script should automatically
save this plot in a file called "mp2.png"

Tips:

- See http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/pyplot_tutorial.html
- For semilog plots you can use matplotlib.pyplot.semilogy()
- For saving a figure, see matplotlib.pyplot.savefig()
- Note that calling matplotlib.pyplot.show() clears the plot
