# Getting started

- Why python: 
    - scripted 
    - dynamic types
    - multi-platform 
    - many libraries
    - multi-purpose (science, automation, web, GUIs, ...)
    - free
    - easy!

# Installation:
    
for this course we will use conda (see the pre-course info)
but if you use reasonably recent linux distro, you may 
alternatively also install the packages from the official repositories

## Which version of python (2.x vs 3.x): 

- As a general rule, (at the time of writing (December 2019)
  we recommend using at least 3.7
- ... or 3.5 if you need to run code on a debian stretch (e.g. in ALBA debian machines)
- ... or 2.7 only if you need to run code in very old machines (e.g. old SuSe machines at ALBA)

# interactive mode vs scripts

- `ipython`
- `python hello.py`
- Space matters!!! (set tabs=4 spaces)
- For a "matlab-like" IDE, use [spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) or [jupyter lab](https://jupyter.org/)
- For "serious" development, we recommend [PyCharm **Community Edition**](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)
